Welcome to OpenSWARMS

This project contains code for several different platforms, all of which will be explained herin


Client Code
socketXBOXControllerForSWARMS

Embedded Code
SWARMS SHARP Socket Host

PIC Code
SWARMS Common
Common define values used when programming for SWARMS embedded accross different embedded platforms

UBW SWARMS Pic 18f2553
Contains the code needed to run the SWARMS protocol on the USB UBW sold by SparkFun using the pic 18f2553


Installation notes:
The UBW bootloader definitely needs to be installed otherwise you must use the In Circuit Serial Programing interface with wires
that's no fun, but the code in UBW SWARMS Pic will work

Right now the client and embedded code works on windows and is written in C#
